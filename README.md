Hi, I'm Schotur, a beginner developer from northern germany. I just started my programming journey, but I am eager to learn new, exiting things about programming. 
My repos are private at the Moment (and therefore are my language stats at 0), but sometime in the future, there will be public ones.


# Stats

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Schotur&langs_count=8&theme=gotham)



# Learning

I try to learn anything related to programming, like using Github. 

The languages I'm currently learning are JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C# and C++ (And HTML and CSS).


# Want to talk to me?
